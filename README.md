`npx simulate shop` will auto scaffold an e-commerce website with a Homepage, product listings page, product detail page, about us page, cart and checkout page. It will also include basic styling for you to get started.

2. **Customize**
   Each project generated by Simulacrum includes a standardized folder structure:

```
my-app/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
├── .env
└── package.json
```

You'll also have the ability to install bundled addons that are common to your template type.
For example you can run the command `npx simulate ecommerce plugins`. This will provide a checklist in CLI for you to choose common plugins used in ecommerce (for example, 3rd party checkout, payment processor, pixels etc)
